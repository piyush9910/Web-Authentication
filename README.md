Hello Everyone ! I am back with a new post. Today I made a Web Authentication Platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the most demanding skill today firebase. I learned how to authenticate logins and sign up too. I also got to know about how to forget password at the backend. We all login, signup and rest our passwords everyday but today I learned about the backend working using firebase. I am going to share more videos on firebase projects by social login like google, Facebook, Microsoft etc.
